This folder contain csv files of paths that are either;
'Optimal' (don't include errors in path due to a singularity point in the path)
or 'Singular' (Containing a singularity pint in the path and causinng the robot arm to stop). 
These paths are the most efficient route from one point to another, but roughly half of the dataset is of examples contain singular routes and half contain optimal.
